- **PYUSD**: 6 decimals (display max 2 decimals in UI)
- **Authentication**: Bearer token with wallet signature verification
- **Network**: Ethereum Sepolia (auto-switch if user on wrong network)

**Key Business Rules & Constraints:**
- âœ… **One Ticket Per Event**: One wallet can only purchase one ticket per event
- âœ… **One Wallet Per Account**: Strict 1:1 wallet-to-account mapping (no transfers in MVP)
- âœ… **Withdrawal Anytime**: Organizers can withdraw revenue at any time (no restrictions)
- âœ… **Event Editing Rules**:
  - Before tickets sold: Can edit all fields
  - After tickets sold: Can only edit title, description, and image
  - Cannot edit: price, dateTime, maxAttendees after tickets sold
- âœ… **Event Deletion**: Not allowed once any tickets have been sold
- âœ… **No Refunds in MVP**: Placeholder added in contract for future implementation
- âœ… **Immutable Contract**: No upgrade mechanism (no proxy pattern for MVP)
- âœ… **JWT Expiration**: 7-day expiry, no refresh token (user must reconnect)
- âœ… **Gas Estimation**: Show estimated gas fees before all transactions
- âœ… **Demo Strategy**: Manual event creation, no seed data (keep it real)

**Token Flow**:
1. User connects wallet and signs message
2. Backend verifies signature and creates JWT (7-day expiry)
3. Frontend stores JWT and uses for all API calls
4. After 7 days, JWT expires and user must reconnect wallet

**Test**:
- Protected route without auth header - returns 401

## Notes for Developers

### General Principles
- Test each step before moving to the next
- Commit code frequently with clear messages
- Use feature branches for development
- Write clean, commented code
- Follow security best practices
- Handle errors gracefully
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Keep it simple - avoid over-engineering

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't store sensitive data in code or git
- Don't skip smart contract testing
- Don't expose API keys in frontend
- Don't skip input validation
- Don't assume transactions will succeed
- Don't forget mobile responsiveness
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't forget timezone conversions (UTC in DB, local for display)
- Don't forget PYUSD has 6 decimals (display max 2)
- Don't forget image size limit (8MB)

### Important Specifications to Remember
- **Node.js**: 20.12.2
- **Database**: Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: Bearer tokens (JWT, 7-day expiry, no refresh token)
- **PYUSD Decimals**: 6 (display max 2)
- **Image Storage**: Base64 in MongoDB (8MB limit)
- **Timezone**: UTC in database, convert to user's local using moment.js
- **Email**: SendGrid
- **Testing**: Jest for backend, Hardhat for contracts
- **Network**: Sepolia (auto-switch if wrong network)
- **Ticket States**: created â†’ blockchain_added â†’ calendar_added
- **One Wallet = One Account**: Strict 1:1 mapping, no wallet transfers in MVP
- **One Ticket Per Event**: One wallet can only buy one ticket per event
- **Withdrawal**: Organizers can withdraw anytime (no time restrictions)
- **Event Editing**: After tickets sold, only title/description/image can be updated
- **Event Deletion**: Not allowed once any tickets sold
- **Refunds**: Not in MVP (placeholder in contract for future)
- **Smart Contract**: Immutable (no proxy pattern for MVP)
- **Gas Estimation**: Show before all transactions

### When Stuck
1. Check documentation for the specific technology
2. Review error messages carefully
3. Test components in isolation
4. Ask for help with specific error details
5. Check similar examples in codebase
