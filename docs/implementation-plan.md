## Notes for Developers

### General Principles
- Test each step before moving to the next
- Commit code frequently with clear messages
- Use feature branches for development
- Write clean, commented code
- Follow security best practices
- Handle errors gracefully
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't store sensitive data in code or git
- Don't skip smart contract testing
- Don't forget to encrypt Google OAuth tokens
- Don't expose API keys in frontend
- Don't skip input validation
- Don't assume transactions will succeed
- Don't forget mobile responsiveness
- Don't skip error handling

### When Stuck
1. Check documentation for the specific technology
2. Review error messages carefully
3. Test components in isolation
4. Ask for help with specific error details
5. Check similar examples in codebase
