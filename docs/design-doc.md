# Ticketify: Online Event Ticketing Platform with PYUSD

## Executive Summary

Ticketify is a blockchain-based online event ticketing platform that enables event organizers to create virtual events on Google Meet and sell tickets using PayPal USD (PYUSD). When users purchase tickets, they are automatically added to a private Google Meet session, eliminating manual attendee management and ensuring only paying participants can join.
