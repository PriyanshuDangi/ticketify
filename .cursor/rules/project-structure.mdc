# Ticketify Project Structure

This is a blockchain-based ticketing application with the following structure:

## Directory Organization

- **client/** - Frontend application code
- **server/** - Backend API and database code
- **contracts/** - Smart contracts for blockchain integration
- **docs/** - Project documentation

## Key Guidelines

- Keep frontend code isolated in the `client/` directory
- All backend logic and database operations belong in `server/`
- Smart contract code and blockchain-related logic goes in `contracts/`
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between these layers
