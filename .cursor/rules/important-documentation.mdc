# IMPORTANT: Documentation Requirements

## Before Writing Any Code

**ALWAYS read these documentation files first:**

1. **[docs/@architecture.md](mdc:docs/@architecture.md)** - Contains the complete architecture overview including the entire database schema
2. **[docs/@design-doc.md](mdc:docs/@design-doc.md)** - Contains the complete design specifications and requirements

These documents are the source of truth for the project structure, design decisions, and implementation details. Understanding them is critical before making any code changes.

## After Completing Work

**Update documentation after major changes:**

- After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update [memory-bank/@architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/@architecture.md) to reflect the current state of the system

## Why This Matters

- Ensures all code aligns with the overall architecture and design vision
- Prevents inconsistencies and duplicate implementations
- Maintains accurate database schema and relationships
- Keeps team aligned on system design and patterns
- Preserves institutional knowledge through documentation updates
